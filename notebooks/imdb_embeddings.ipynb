    "Another popular and powerful way to associate a vector with a word is the use of dense \"word vectors\", also called \"word embeddings\". \n",
    "While the vectors obtained through one-hot encoding are binary, sparse (mostly made of zeros) and very high-dimensional (same dimensionality as the \n",
    "number of words in the vocabulary), \"word embeddings\" are low-dimensional floating point vectors \n",
    "(i.e. \"dense\" vectors, as opposed to sparse vectors). \n",
    "Unlike word vectors obtained via one-hot encoding, word embeddings are learned from data. \n",
    "It is common to see word embeddings that are 256-dimensional, 512-dimensional, or 1024-dimensional when dealing with very large vocabularies. \n",
    "On the other hand, one-hot encoding words generally leads to vectors that are 20,000-dimensional or higher (capturing a vocabulary of 20,000 \n",

    "\n",
    "The simplest way to associate a dense vector to a word would be to pick the vector at random. The problem with this approach is that the \n",
    "resulting embedding space would have no structure: for instance, the words \"accurate\" and \"exact\" may end up with completely different \n",
    "embeddings, even though they are interchangeable in most sentences. It would be very difficult for a deep neural network to make sense of \n",
    "such a noisy, unstructured embedding space. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get a bit more abstract: the geometric relationships between word vectors should reflect the semantic relationships between these words. \n",
    "Word embeddings are meant to map human language into a geometric space. For instance, in a reasonable embedding space, we would expect \n",
    "synonyms to be embedded into similar word vectors, and in general we would expect the geometric distance (e.g. L2 distance) between any two \n",
    "word vectors to relate to the semantic distance of the associated words (words meaning very different things would be embedded to points \n",
    "far away from each other, while related words would be closer). Even beyond mere distance, we may want specific __directions__ in the \n",
    "embedding space to be meaningful. \n",
    "\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world word embedding spaces, common examples of meaningful geometric transformations are \"gender vectors\" and \"plural vector\". For \n",
    "instance, by adding a \"female vector\" to the vector \"king\", one obtain the vector \"queen\". By adding a \"plural vector\", one obtain \"kings\". \n",
    "Word embedding spaces typically feature thousands of such interpretable and potentially useful vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there some \"ideal\" word embedding space that would perfectly map human language and could be used for any natural language processing \n",
    "task? Possibly, but in any case, we have yet to compute anything of the sort. Also, there isn't such a thing as \"human language\", there are \n",
    "many different languages and they are not isomorphic, as a language is the reflection of a specific culture and a specific context. But more \n",
    "pragmatically, what makes a good word embedding space depends heavily on your task: the perfect word embedding space for an \n",
    "English-language movie review sentiment analysis model may look very different from the perfect embedding space for an English-language \n",
    "legal document classification model, because the importance of certain semantic relationships varies from task to task.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is thus reasonable to __learn__ a new embedding space with every new task. Thankfully, backpropagation makes this really easy, and Keras makes it \n",
    "even easier. It's just about learning the weights of a layer: the `Embedding` layer."
